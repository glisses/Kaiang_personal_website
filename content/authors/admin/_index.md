## Bio

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology, working with [Prof. Mark Roman Miller](https://markromanmiller.com/). I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Beijing Jiaotong University.

My research interest lies in the intersection of **Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR)**, **Machine Learning**, and **Computer Vision**, with a focus on understanding user behavior and cognitive states in immersive environments. **My vision** is to create  systems that can quietly sense what users are thinking or feeling and adjust in real time, to make digital experiences more dynamic, natural, and seamless.
