abstract: 'The VR Motion Tracker is a Unity-based application designed for motion data tracking in VR experiments using the Meta Quest 3 headset. Built upon the Unity MR template and UXF framework, it records the position and rotation of the headset and controllers, exporting this data in CSV format for analysis. The application also offers 3D motion visualization and user interaction through hand-controller inputs.'
